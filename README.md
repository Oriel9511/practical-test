# PracticalTest

This project technical practice that can be executed using the `start.sh` script.

## Running the Projects

To run the projects, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have nodejs v20 or above installed on your machine.
2. Open a terminal in the root directory of the project.
3. Execute the following command:

```bash
bash start.sh 
```

This script will start all the required components of the project.

## Potential Improvements

### Data Persistence
- Implement a SQL or NoSQL database for data persistence instead of in-memory storage.
- This would enhance data durability and allow for more complex querying capabilities.

### API Architecture
- Implement middlewares for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, error handling, and authentication.
- Develop controllers to handle request/response logic and route management.
- Create services to encapsulate business logic.
- Implement repositories for data access abstraction.

### Application Layering
- Separate the application into distinct layers (e.g., Presentation, Application, Domain, Infrastructure) to improve maintainability and scalability.

### SOLID Principles
- Apply SOLID principles, particularly the Dependency Inversion Principle, to create more modular and extensible code.
- Use dependency injection to decouple high-level modules from low-level modules.

### Testing
- Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

### Documentation
- Enhance API documentation using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI.
- Provide clear code comments and maintain up-to-date documentation for each component.

### Containerization
- Consider using Docker to containerize the application, ensuring consistency across different environments.

By implementing these improvements, the project will become more robust, maintainable, and scalable, adhering to best practices in software development.
